SYSTEM RULES FOR UI GENERATION
--------------------------------

1) Structure (hierarchical)
   - Departments
       → Regulations (only 2019–2023, 2023–2027)
           → Classes
               → Sections
                   → Students

2) Navigation
   - All layers must show a "View" button.
   - Clicking View loads the next level via AJAX (no page reload).
   - Data dynamically replaces content on the current page.

3) Data
   - No backend.
   - Generate seeded sample data.
   - Students must be unique per (Department + Regulation + Section).

<!-- 4) Requirements
   - Remove “programmes” completely from UI.
   - Add note in a CHANGELOG entry that "programmes" is temporarily removed.
   - Fix routing so navigation never goes blank.
   - Use correct route parameters + JSON responses for each level. -->
